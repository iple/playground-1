We shall make the guess $T(n) \le n\lg{n} + n$:

$$ \begin{aligned}
     T(n) & \le 2(c\lfloor n/2 \rfloor\lg{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor} + \lfloor n/2 \rfloor) + n \\\\
          & \le 2c(n/2)\lg(n/2) + 2(n/2) + n \\\\
          & \le cn\lg(n/2) + 2n \\\\
          & \le cn\lg(n/2) + 2n \\\\
          & \le cn\lg{n} - cn\lg{2} + 2n \\\\
          & \le cn\lg{n} + (2 - c)n \qquad (c \ge 1)\\\\
          & \le cn\lg{n} + n
   \end{aligned} $$

This time, the boundary condition is:

$$ T(1) = 1 \le cn\lg{n} + n = 0 + 1 = 1 $$
