### The first bound

This can be reduced to a counting problem: in how many ways can we pick $n$
items out of $2n$ items? That way we pick the first sorted list and each such
pick determines a single, unique second list. In exercise C.1-13 we already
proved that:

$$ \binom{2n}{n} = \frac{2^{2n}}{\sqrt{\pi n}}(1 + \O(1/n)) $$

Using the familiar reasoning, if there are $l$ leaves in the decision tree and
its height is $h$, the following inequality must hold:

$$ \frac{2^{2n}}{\sqrt{\pi n}}(1 + \O(1/n)) \le l \le 2^h $$

Taking the logarithm of the leftmost and rightmost parts (and inverting their
positions) we get;

$$ \begin{aligned}
   h & \ge \lg\bigg(\frac{2^{2n}}{\sqrt{\pi n}}(1 + \O(1/n))\bigg) \\\\
     & = \lg{2^{2n}} - \lg\sqrt{\pi n} + \lg(1 + O(1/n)) \\\\
     & = 2n - \o(n)
   \end{aligned} $$

### The tighter bound

If we don't compare two consecutive elements, we don't know which one comes
first. They are completely indistinguishable when comparing to the other
elements. We have no way in determining which one should come first. (Note
that if they were in the same sorted list, we don't need to compare them,
since we already have that information).

If the sorted order of the elements is $\langle a_1, b_2, a_2, b_2, \ldots,
a_n, b_n \rangle$ and we have the two lists $\langle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
\rangle$ and $\langle b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \rangle$, then there are $2n - 1$
pairs of elements that need to be compared. Any algorithm that handles this
case must perform $2n - 1$ comparisons in the worst case.
