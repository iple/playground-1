With the elements 1, 2 and 3, there are only $5$ possible binary search trees:

    1             1            2           3           3
      \             \        /  \        /           /
        2             3     1    3      1          2
          \         /                    \       /
            3     2                       2     1

There are, however $3! = 6$ by the definition of the chapter.
