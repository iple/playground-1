$$ \begin{aligned}
   \E[X] &= \sum_{x}x \cdot \Pr\\{X \ge t\\} \\\\
         &= \sum_{x < t}x \cdot \Pr\\{X = x\\} + \sum_{x \ge t} x \cdot \Pr\\{X = x\\} \\\\
         & \ge \sum_{x < t}x \cdot \Pr\\{X = x\\} + \sum_{x \ge t} t \cdot \Pr\\{X = x\\} \\\\
         & \ge t \sum_{x \ge t} \Pr\\{X = x\\} \\\\
         &= t \cdot \Pr\\{X \ge t\\}
   \end{aligned} $$

Chaning $x$ with $t$ in one of the sum works, since that is the sum where $x
\ge t$.

Thus follows:

$$ \E[X] \ge t \cdot \Pr\\{X \ge t\\} \\\\
   \Downarrow \\\\
   \Pr\\{X \ge t\\} \le \E[X]/t $$
