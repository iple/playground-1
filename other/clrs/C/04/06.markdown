Let's do what the hint says: call tails for Professor Guildenstern a success
and heads - failure. They have the same numbers of heads when they have
$k + (n - k) = n$ successes out of $2n$ trials.

$$ \Pr\\{R=G\\} = b(n;2n;1/2)
                = \binom{2n}{n} \frac{1}{2^n} \frac{1}{2^n}
                = \binom{2}{n}/4^n $$

Alternatively, we can just calculate the probability and see what happens:

$$ \begin{aligned}
   \Pr\\{R=G\\} &= \sum_{k=0}^n \Pr\\{R=k\\}\Pr\\{G=n-k\\} \\\\
                &= \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{2^n} \cdot
                               \binom{n}{n-k} \cdot \frac{1}{2^n} \\\\
                &= \frac{1}{4^n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k} \binom{n}{n-k} \\\\
                &= \frac{1}{4^n} \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}^2
  \end{aligned} $$

Those are two ways we can express the same value. This let's us verify the
identity.
