Let's figure out when when we have a colliding pair. We need to have:

$$ h_b(k) = h_b(l) $$

Which is better written as:

$$ h_b(k) - h_b(l) = 0 \mod p $$

Well, if we calculate the difference:

$$
    h_b(k) - h_b(l) = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}{k_j b^j} - \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}{l_j b^j}
                    = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1}{(k_j - l_j) b^j}
$$

Which is a polynomial of the $(n-1)$-th degree. The referred exercise is a
theorem, that tells us this polynomial would have a most $n-1$ zeroes modulo
$p$.

There are $p$ possible functions, at most $n-1$ of which will cause any pair to
have a collision, therefore:

$$ \Pr\\{ h(k) = h(l) \\} \le \frac{n-1}{p} $$
