Two things are clear from the properties:

1. Red nodes have black children.
2. Red nodes have black parents.

Both follow from property 4, which implies that a red node cannot be a parent of
another red node. Alternatively put, each path to a leaf may go through
subsequent black nodes, but no two red nodes in a row.

This means that the most complicated subtree is going to look like this:

If we "absorb" the red nodes, node 4 will end up having four children (1, 3, 5,
7), that is, a degree of $4$ and no more.

The depth of the resulting leaves can at most halve. That is, if a leaf had
depth $n$, it's new depth is going to be at least $\lceil n / 2 \rceil$.
