As discussed in the previous two exercises, there can be no more red nodes than
black nodes.

The smallest possible number will be obtained if all the nodes are black, that
is $2^k - 1$.

The largest possible number will be obtained if we have a layer of red nodes,
followed by a layer of black nodes, producing a tree of height $2k$, and $2^{2k}
- 1$ nodes.
