Here's a tree with black-height $2$.

This is the most "balanced" tree possible.

Property 4 is the most limiting one â€“ red nodes need to have black children.
There's nothing preventing a black node to have black children. Thus, one way to
reach black-height $3$ is:

Finally, to get black-height of $4$, all the nodes need to be black:
