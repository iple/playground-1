The math can get quite complicated if $n$ is not one less than a power of $2$.
Reasoning informally:

The smallest possible ratio is obtained by black-only nodes and is going to be
$0$.

The largest possible ratio is obtained by each black node having two red
children, and is going to be $2$. Here's an illustration:

There are 5 black internal nodes and 10 red internal nodes, making a ratio of
$2$.
