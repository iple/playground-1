Both the shortest path $s$ and the longest path $l$ will have the same number of
black nodes, as per property 5. Because of property 4, each red node must have a
black parent and black children. This means that the number of red nodes must be
less than or equal to the number of black nodes in any path in a valid red-black
tree.

The biggest difference then, can be obtained if $s$ contains only black nodes
and $l$ contains the same number of black nodes with the maximum possible red
nodes added to it, which is $2s$.
