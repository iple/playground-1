Yes. Checking the properties:

1. **Every node is either red or black**. Holds.
2. **The root is black.** Holds after coloring.
3. **Every leaf ($\mathrm{NIL}$) is black.** Holds, since the leaves were black
   in the relaxed tree.
4. **If a node is red, then both its children are black**. Holds. The only
   potential candidate to break the property is the root, which is now black,
   and has no parents.
5. **For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain
   the same number of black nodes**. Continues to hold, as the all paths from
   the root get a potential extra black node and the rest remain unchanged.
