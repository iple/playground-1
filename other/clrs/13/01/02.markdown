The new element is going to be the gray one:

If we color it red, it will violate property 4, that is, red nodes need to have
black children. In this case, it's parent, 35 is red, so it must be black.

If we color it black, it will violate property 5. The path to the descendants of
36 from the root will have 4 black nodes, but the one to the descendants of 39
will have 3.

That is, `TREE-INSERT` does not produce a valid red-black tree in this case,
regardless of how we color the node.
