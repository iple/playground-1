We can do it by allocating extra $\O(\lg n)$ memory.

When inserting, we're descending the tree to the position we want to insert in.
If we keep track of the stack of parents we visit (there $\O(\lg n)$ are of
them), we can then calculate $z.p$ and $z.p.p$ using that stack. We will need to
pass the relevant parent to `LEFT-ROTATE` and `RIGHT-ROTATE` as well.

Problem 13.1 actually implements this.
